# OpenLR2
Rewritten source code of bms player Lunatic Rave 2
Project started Jan, 2021.(and aged about 1 year) And now it's about to release.

if there is any different behavior with LR2beta3100201, plaese let me know.
current progress is refactoring at LR2Beta4 branch
original codes remain at LR2Beta3-v100201 branch

# is it really open source?
I didn't decide yet, I asked stakeholders(IR manager) but there was no reply

# installation
get original LR2 beta3 100201
put OpenLR2.exe into the folder and run (or you can replace original LR2body.exe )

# caution
It uses same score DB with origianl one.
To avoid data corruption, do not run this on where you played original LR2 (or use -ns option).
recommend use newly installed LR2.
sending score to LR2IR is disabled to avoid accidents.
(accidents can be occur, by saving score with OpenLR2 and sending score with original LR2. DO NOT MIX yet)

# known issues
 - score save issue on NONSTOP MIX
 - readme left click scroll is faster than original (not important)

# build
use visual studio 2022, right click on OpenLR2_vs22, build. x86 release build only
